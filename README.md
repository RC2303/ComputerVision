# Object Recognition

## Description

- The synthetic dataset provided contains labeled images of jacks, dollies, and bins in the BMW JSON format.
- The objective of the project is to preprocess the dataset, converting images and labels from JSON to the YOLO format for training object detection models.
- Train the object detection model using the YOLO algorithm, partitioning the dataset into train, test, and validation folders to assess performance.
- Compare different model configurations to determine the most effective one, visualizing training metrics using TensorBoard.
- Convert the trained model's weights (best.pt) to the ONNX format to optimize for deployment and assess detection speed.
- Evaluate the speed and accuracy of both the YOLO and ONNX models for object detection.
- Analyze the network architecture using Netron.
- Currently working in the process of developing an API for seamless integration of the object detection functionality and Dockerizing the application for easy 
  deployment and scalability.
